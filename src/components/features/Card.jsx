        <h5>
          Hey there! I'm Gopal Katiyar, a third-year Electronics and
          Communication Engineering (ECE) student at the Institute of
          Engineering and Technology, Lucknow. I'm passionate about frontend web
          development and currently exploring the MERN stack (MongoDB,
          Express.js, React, and Node.js).
        </h5>
        <h2 className="text-green-600 text-lg"> My Journey</h2>
        <h5>
          I discovered my love for programming and web development during my
          starting year at my college. Since then, I've been on a journey of
          continuous learning and growth, diving deep into HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React to craft intuitive user interfaces.
        </h5>

        <h2 className="text-green-600 text-lg">The Present</h2>
        <h5>
          Currently, I'm expanding my skills to become proficient in the MERN
          stack, aiming to become a full-stack developer. My interest in
          programming enriches my problem-solving abilities, making me adept at
          debugging and optimizing code.
        </h5>

        <h2 className="text-green-600 text-lg">Looking Ahead</h2>
        <h5>
          As I approach my final year, I'm excited to apply my skills to
          real-world projects and internships, particularly interested in the
          intersection of IoT and web technologies. I'm always open to
          collaboration and eager to explore new opportunities in tech.
